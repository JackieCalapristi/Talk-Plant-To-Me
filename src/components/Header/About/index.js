      This app was originally created because I wanted to help my Mom, an avid gardener, learn more about her plants. 
      I hope it helps you learn more about your plants, and any plant you're curious about, too! 
      I owe so much gratitude to the creators of and contributors to the Trefle API, whom without this web app could not be possible. 
      Also whom without, I could have never discovered just how many plants are, in fact, not vegetables. 
      Thank you so much for visiting, I wholeheartedly hope you enjoy using this web app.Â
